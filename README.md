# Zphero #4 The-Memorial-Sphere

Zphero is opening up sphere #4 as part of its core system.

To perserve the chains integrity, this sphere on the chain will feature a collection of placeholders, that will be placed into datapoints that are sent to the 0 point, destroyed, or whats commonly known as "burned" in block chain terminology.

There are only a limited number (360) datapoints on the sphere before it closes and becomes immutable.

These will become selectable defaults that users can select to put in place of the datapoint they are destroying, so there will be lots of potential for exposure. Please credit yourself!

## What we are looking for: Art, music, videos, cool single page coding and/or scripts, animations etc.

# Limit: 10mb.

# How to contribute:

Pick any address with nothing in it. Place your contribution at the address with its name as the address, or simply upload 1 file and an address will be assigned to it.

# Rules
Please only family friendly, considerate, non-harmful content.
Contribute original works only, don't infringe upon others rights or engage in plaguerism.
Maintain respect and overall innocence.
Your content may be removed without explanation, but will not be reused.
This is purely a community volunteer project, no compensation or royalties will be given by Zphero, however you maintain the rights to use your works elsewhere.
Once the sphere has closed it will be put on the chain and become immutable. Choose wisely.
